About
=====

This simple app was inspired by having days of indecisiveness about where to go eat lunch, as well as being
wary of trying new places. The restaurant can be randomized continuously until one finds one of preference,
however I find committing to go to one of the first 3 results leads to the most adventurous lunches!
