Tell me where to get lunch!

The start of the GrubFinder project. On hold.


A demo of the site (Still in dev, on hold, but still usable) is accessible at:

About
=====

This simple app was inspired by having days of indecisiveness about where to go eat lunch, as well as being
wary of trying new places. The restaurant can be randomized continuously until one finds one of preference,
however I find committing to go to one of the first 3 results leads to the most adventurous lunches!

This project was initially named GrubHub but has been changed to GrubFinder to avoid confusion with grubhub.com
